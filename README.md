# aComboPoint
WoW Classic addon to show compact and sleek combo points.

## Intro
Very simple and minimal combo point tracker I wrote in order to integrate with [Zork's UI](https://github.com/zorker/rothui). It can both hook to [oUF_SimpleConfig](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24264-oUF_SimpleConfig.html)'s layout, or work standalone.

It has both graphic and text modes. All configuration needs to be done inside the Lua file.

Changelog
  * 1.0: Initial upload
  * 1.1: Made Zork's dependency optional, now works completely standalone too.
